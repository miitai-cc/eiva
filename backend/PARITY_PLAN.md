## Remaining Gaps

### ⚠️ Incomplete Items (from phases above)

1. **CLI env var precedence audit** — env var override behavior not fully audited against OpenClaw (Phase 1)
2. **Dedicated TUI log view** — messages pane exists but no separate log/debug view (Phase 5)
3. **Cross-tool secret import** — legacy migration works but OpenClaw→RustyClaw secret import not tested (Phase 6)
4. **Doctor command edge cases** — `--repair` exists but doesn't cover all invalid config states (Phase 7)
5. **Dedicated migration guide** — only config.example.toml exists; no step-by-step migration doc (Phase 7)

### ⚠️ Stub / Partial Implementations

6. ~~**Canvas tool** — accepts parameters and returns descriptive text but has no actual canvas rendering integration~~ → **Implemented**: opens system browser, fetches page metadata/content, tracks canvas URL
7. ~~**Browser tool (without `browser` feature)** — returns stub descriptions~~ → **Implemented**: lite mode with reqwest, tab tracking, HTML parsing, accessibility snapshots
8. **TTS tool (without API key)** — returns a descriptive fallback; functional when OPENAI_API_KEY is set (`src/tools/gateway_tools.rs:370`)
9. ~~**Process tool: `send-keys`** — not implemented~~ → **Implemented**: `send_keys` action translates named keys (Enter, Ctrl-C, arrows, F-keys, etc.) to escape sequences

### ⚠️ Missing OpenClaw Features

10. **WhatsApp messenger backend** — OpenClaw supports WhatsApp; RustyClaw does not
11. **Slack messenger backend** — OpenClaw supports Slack; RustyClaw does not
12. **SECURITY.md accuracy** — document references wrong crate (`keyring` instead of `securestore`) and lists outdated dependency versions

### ✅ Previously Missing, Now Implemented

- Gateway control tool (config get/apply/patch, restart) — `src/tools/gateway_tools.rs`
- True streaming from providers (OpenAI SSE + Anthropic SSE) — `src/streaming.rs`, `src/gateway/providers.rs`
- Sandbox enforcement (PathValidation, Bubblewrap, Landlock, LandlockBwrap, Docker, macOS sandbox-exec) — `src/sandbox.rs`
- Canvas tool (system browser launch, page metadata fetch, text snapshot) — `src/tools/devices.rs`
- Browser lite mode (reqwest-based tab management, HTML parsing, accessibility snapshots) — `src/tools/browser.rs`
- Process send-keys (named key → escape sequence translation) — `src/process_manager.rs`, `src/tools/runtime.rs`
